== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= What do I need for this Widget? =
You need a last.fm Account and a Player with last.fm support. See also the last topic of the FAQ

= The green and the red guy are really nice, but I prefere other images - What can I do? =

In the folder [wp-blog]/wp-content/plugins/schmie_lstfm2/img/ are
2 images rot.jpg (not listening) and gruen.jpg  (listening to music) replace them and make me sad:(

= My Music Player is on, but the widgets means I'm offline :( =
At first you must have an MP3-Player wich send's infos to last.fm. 
That works great under Linux with Amarok. I think that iTunes can do it to and there's a plugin for foobar2k. 
The status can also be offline for a short time when you play a new title
